## Hospital Background
A hospital network manages daily healthcare operations by recording patient visits, admissions, discharges, doctor consultations, medical report, billing information, and treatment outcomes. The system tracks patient demographics, department-wise patient flow, medication prescriptions. The hospital aims to improve patient care quality, provide better health care, optimize resource utilization, and support clinical and administrative decision-making using data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
The problem that hospital is facing:-
1. Hospitals generate large volumes of daily data related to patients, doctors, treatments, and billing.
2. Lack of centralized data management affects monitoring of patient flow, proper reporting, and resource utilization.
3. Hospital staff face challenges in tracking consultation history, medication details, and treatment outcomes.

## Solutions
1. Develop a centralized hospital database system to store patient, doctor, treatment, and billing records.
2. Use SQL queries to analyze daily patient visits, admissions, and discharge data.
3. Analyze billing and revenue data for financial decision-making.
